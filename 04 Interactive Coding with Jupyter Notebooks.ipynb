    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first section, you are going to learn how to represent different\n",
    "kinds of data and store them in variables. You will encounter\n",
    "four basic data types: integers, floating-point numbers, Boolean values\n",
    "and text strings. You are also going to use lists which are collections\n",
    "of data. Data can be assigned to a variable using the `=` operator which\n",
    "takes the value on the right and assigns it to the variable on the left.\n",
    "In this sense, a variable is simply a container that we can use to store\n",
    "and access data. The data type of a variable can be determined with the\n",
    "`type()` function. We can also convert variables from one type to\n",
    "another - for example, the `int()` function will try to convert a\n",
    "variable to an integer. Finally, Python provides operators for the\n",
    "arithmetic operations like addition `+`, subtraction `-`, multiplication\n",
    "`*` and division `/`. Let's test how this works!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",

The first dimension represents the number of frames and the second and third dimensions represent the height and width of the images. We can select specific pixels or patches of the image by indexing the array. To get one element, i.e. one pixel in a single frame, we give a number for each dimension in the array. For example, `frames[0, 50, 100]` would get the pixel at y=50 and x=100 in the first frame. We can also get all elements along a certain dimension by putting `:` instead of a number. For example, `frames[:, 50, 100]` would get all frames for the same pixel. Finally, we can index across a certain range, for example `frames[0:100, 50, 100]` would get the first 100 frames for that pixel. We can also apply mathematical operations like the mean across specific dimensions. For example, `frames.mean(axis=0)` would average across the first dimension (i.e. images) and give us the average brightness for every pixel.\n",
